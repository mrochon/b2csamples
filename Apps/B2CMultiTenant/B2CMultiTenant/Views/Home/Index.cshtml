        <p>Demonstrates the use of a single Azure AD B2C directory as identity service for a multi-tenant SaaS application.</p>
        <p>
            A SaaS application commonly uses the concept of a <b>tenant</b> to group users whose use of the application
            is separated from its use by any other group. For example, a SaaS application may provide accounting
            services. Each business using the application is considered a tenant in the application. To distinguish such a tenant
            from Azure AD tenants, this application uses the term <b>application tenant</b>. (Azure AD is also a SaaS application, hence it
            also has the concept of a tenant).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sample an individual can either <a href="~/home/newtenant">create</a> a new application tenant or <a href="/home/membersignin">
            sign in</a> to a tenant they are already a member of. Once a tenant is created, it's creator (admin)
            can invite other users by sending an invitation generated by this application to their email address. (That functionality is
            exposed only to creators of new tenants).
        </p>
        <p>
        Once signed up, a user may sign-in again by appending <i>?p=tenantName</i> parameter to the app url. (I am currently experimenting with 
        another user journey which will not need a tenant name but will always sign in the user to the first tenant the user is a member of).
